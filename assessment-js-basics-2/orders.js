    In this file, you'll be writing a class
    to make tickets from order information.
*/


//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*  
    Create a new class called `Ticket`.
    Make sure to call your constructor, and 
    require these 3 parameters: items, orderTime, 
    customerId. Additionally, set up a property
    called `status` that always has an initial
    value of 'queued'.

    Create a method on the class called `updateStatus`.
    The method should have one parameter, `newStatus`,
    which will be a string.

    Inside the method, set the value of `this.status`
    to be the new status that was sent in. Then
    console.log something like: 
    'The order for customer [CUSTOMERID] is
    now [STATUS].'
    Where CUSTOMERID and STATUS reference the values
    stored on the object.
*/

let Ticket = class{
    constructor(items, ordertime, customerId, Status){
    this.status = `queued`;
    this.items = items;
    this.ordertime = ordertime;
    this.customerId = customerId;
}} 




/*
    Create a new instance of your class.
    Save it to a variable called `firstTicket`.

    You can use this sample data or make
    up your own:
    food ordered: pizza, bread, and soda
    ordered at: 7:03 PM
    customer: 575

/*
    Call the `updateStatus` method on

    'cooking'
